# Text Encryption
Plain Text  --> No Encryption
Encoding --> Example: base64
Hashing --> Example: SHA-256
Encryption --> Types: Symmmetric Encryption , Aysmmetric Encryption

# Types of Keys
1. Public Key (Used for encryption)
2. Private Key (Used for Asmmetric Encryption)

## Symmetric Encryption
Uses Public Key for both Encryption and Decryption
Key is shared between the sender and receiver

## Asymmetric Encrytion
Uses Public key for Encryption and Private Key for Decryption
Public Key can be Shared with Anyone, but Private Key should remain secret

# Bitcoin Wallet
Private/Public Key Pair
Private Key - Secret Number
Public Key - Publicly Known Number

# Bitcoin Address
A public key that corresponds to a particular private key. It's like an email address. The bitcoins sent to this address will appear as incoming payments.

# Transactions
Inputs -> Amount of bitcoins being sent from one address to another
Outputs -> Amount of bitcoins being sent from one address to another
Signature -> Proof that you are authorized to spend the funds

# Mining
The process of verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain
Reward given to miner who found valid block
Difficulty adjusted every 2 weeks




# Blockchain
A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction is grouped into a "block," which is then added to a chain of other blocks, forming a chronological and immutable record of all transactions. This decentralized nature means that no single entity has control over the entire blockchain, making it resistant to tampering and fraud.

Blockchain technology enables secure and transparent peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions. It is most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its applications extend beyond finance to areas such as supply chain management, voting systems, and smart contracts.




# MetaMask
MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a bridge between your web browser and the Ethereum blockchain, enabling you to manage your Ethereum-based assets, such as Ether (ETH), tokens, and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

# Geth
Geth, short for "Go Ethereum," is one of the most popular implementations of an Ethereum node software. It is written in the Go programming language and serves as a command-line interface (CLI) for running an Ethereum node on a computer or server.




# How To Make A Private Blockchain Network

1) Install Geth on Your System.
   
2) Create a Folder (i.e Private Ethereum).
   
3) Make a genesis.json file for the gensis block and save into that folder.

4) Execute the genesis file by run the commands on terminal, given below.
   
         geth --datadir ./data init ./genesis.json

5) And then Initialize the private network by run command :
    
         geth --datadir .\data\ --nodiscover




# How To Connect With Ethereium Mainnet
**On cmd run command :** 

       geth attach ipc://./pipe/geth.ipc 




# How To Create Account On The Ethereum Mainnet
**On cmd run command:**   

        personal.newAccount()

**And then create your password.**




# How To Mine On The Ethereum Private Network
**After creating account , run the following the commands ;**

          miner.setEtherbase(eth.accounts[0])

          miner.start(1)

**And then miner balanced can be checked by run the following commmand;**

          eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])




# How To Visualize Solidity Smart Contracts

1.) **Install the docker on OS.**

2.) **Pull the docker image for solgraph by run this command on terminal :**

          sudo docker pull devopstestlab/solgraph

**Solgraph:** A tool to generate a DOT graph that visualises the function control flow of a Solidity contract and highlights potential security vulnerabilities.

3.) **Make a directory :** 

           mkdir data
           
4.) **Change the directory :** 

           cd data
           
5.) **Run the command :** 

           vim -vi
           
**And then write the smart contract and save the contract file with .sol extension.(i.e for example Mycontract.sol)**

# Security Audits For Smart Contract Using Slither

**Slither:** An Solidity static analysis framework. Through its printers, it can map method visibility and modifiers, state variables that are read and written, identify calls, and print the inheritance graph of a smart contract.

1.) **Pull the docker image for slither by run this command on terminal :**

            docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
      
2.) **Make a directory :** 

           mkdir audit
